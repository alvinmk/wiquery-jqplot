<p>jqPlot has numerous options for styling. Out of the box, it
supports lines with customizable widths, markers (circles, squares and
diamonds either filled or open as well as dash, X and plus/cross style),
and colors.</p>
<p>The plot title is specified by the "title" attribute. Options for
the title can be used by creating a "title" object instead of a "title"
string.</p>

<div wicket:id="chart1" class="plot"
	style="width: 400px; height: 260px;"></div>

<p>Shadows are also customizable. The angle, offset (distance from
the line), alpha (transparency or darkness) and depth (number of shadow
strokes, offset by "shadowOffset" from eachother) are all customizable.</p>

<div wicket:id="chart2" class="plot"
	style="width: 400px; height: 260px;"></div>

<p>Line data can be specified as an array of [x, y] pairs, or as an
simple 1-D array. If a 1-D array is given, x values are automatically
generated starting at one and increasing by one for each y value in the
array.</p>
<p>Line labels are specified in the "series" options. The "series"
option is an array of option objects, one for each series. Here, the
first series ("Rising line") is rendered as only markers by setting
"showLine:false".</p>

<div wicket:id="chart3" class="plot"
	style="width: 400px; height: 260px;"></div>

<p>Axes ticks are computed automatically from the data, but can be
customized if desired. Ticks can be specified as an array of [value,
label] pairs, or as a 1-D array of labels.</p>
<p>Here the y axis ticks use a custom format string ("%d") to
produce integer tick labels. The default format string is %.1f and can
be customized to any sprintf style format string.Additionally, the grid
background color and grid line color have been changed.</p>

<div wicket:id="chart4" class="plot"
	style="width: 400px; height: 260px;"></div>
