<p>jqPlot support axis labels through the "label" option of each
axis. The default label renderer creates labels in div tags, which
allows full css control over every label. Labels are assigned css
classes like "jqplot-axis_name-label" where "axis_name" will be xaxis,
yaxis, etc.</p>

<div wicket:id="chart1" 
	style="width: 400px; height: 260px;"></div>

<p>By including the "jqplot.canvasTextRenderer.min.js" and
"jqplot.canvasAxisLabelRenderer.min.js" plugins, you can render label
text directly onto canvas elements. This allows text to be rotated and
yaxes will have their labels rotated 90 degrees by default. By default
the labels will be rendered using the Hershey font metrics and not
stroked as text. Most browsers do not yet support native text rendering
in canvas elements.</p>

<div wicket:id="chart2" 
	style="width: 400px; height: 260px;"></div>

<p>Native canvas text rendering is supported in FireFox 3.5+ and
Safari 4+. You can enable native font support in those browsers by
setting the "enableFontSupport" option to true. This allows you to also
specify the font family of text rendered on the canvas labels. If a
visitors is using a supported browser, they will see the labels rendered
as the specified fonts. If they are on an unsupported browser, they will
see the default Hershey font.</p>

<p>The chart below will have labels rendered in 12pt Georgia if you
are on a supported browser. Otherwise, They will be in 12pt Hershey.
Native font support in the canvas element is somewhat inconsistent among
supported browsers and platforms and depends on fonts installed on the
system. Therefore, it should be used cautiously.</p>
